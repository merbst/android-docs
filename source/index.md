## Docs are on GitHub

Apollo Android has been launched and is ready to try in your app today! For now, the docs for the project are hosted on GitHub, please look there: [apollographql/apollo-android](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android).

## Getting involved

Apollo Android is a community-driven project with contributors from many companies. Check out the [blog post introducing the first public release of the project](https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/launching-apollo-graphql-on-android-40ee0b5789bd) and the [project's README](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android) to learn about the current progress.

We're excited about the idea of further [unifying the clients for JavaScript, iOS and Android](https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/one-graphql-client-for-javascript-ios-and-android-64993c1b7991), including sharing a cache between native and React Native.

If you have questions or would like to contribute, please join the `#android` channel on [Slack](http://www.apollodata.com/#slack).

## Other platforms
