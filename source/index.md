This will be the guide to using [Apollo Android](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android), a strongly-typed, caching GraphQL client for native Android apps written in Java.

For now, refer to the [blog post introducing the first public release of the project](https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/launching-apollo-graphql-on-android-40ee0b5789bd) and the [project's README](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android) to get started.

If you have questions or would like to contribute, please join the `#android` channel on [Slack](http://www.apollodata.com/#slack).

[Apollo iOS](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios) is a GraphQL client for native iOS apps, written in Swift.

Apollo Client for JavaScript's [React integration](/react) works with [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) on both iOS and Android.

We're excited about the prospects of further [unifying the clients for JavaScript, iOS and Android](https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/one-graphql-client-for-javascript-ios-and-android-64993c1b7991), including sharing a cache between native and React Native.
